# Hello!

## My name is Parima. I am a professional problem solver and creative coder.

That means I refine strategies, design products, build teams, code things, and most importantly get s\*\*\* done.

## I’ve been doing this for a while now

I attended the University of California, Berkeley and the University of California, San Diego, graduating with a dual degree in Computer Science and Cognitive Science with a minor in Computation. Since then I've worked software consultancy and at a handful of startups, wearing multiple hats, well on my way to becoming a jack of all trades.

## Through my experiences, I’ve learnt:

### User Experience always comes first.

Helping your users, helps you. Sweat the details.

### Thinking before Typing

I believe in thinking through problems (understanding the requirements and specifications), designing a solution and then writing functional code. I’m a fan of Test Driven Development (TTD) in Agile environments.

### Develop pragmatic code

While I’m addicted to DRY code, I understand the need to adapt fast and refactor. Write clean code that works. Period.
